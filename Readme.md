# Basic Keylogger

This project is a simple keylogger built in Python using the `pynput` library. The keylogger records and logs all keystrokes pressed on the keyboard and saves them to a file.

## How it Works

The keylogger listens to the keyboard events and writes the pressed keys into a log file (`keylogs.txt`). Special keys like space, enter, and tab are handled separately for better readability.

### Ethical Considerations

**Important:** This software should only be used for educational purposes, and it is illegal to use it without explicit permission from the owner of the system being monitored. Always ensure you have the proper permissions before running this software on any system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basic-keylogger.git
